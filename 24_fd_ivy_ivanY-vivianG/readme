DISCO:
* you link to the foundation frame work with
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites@6.7.5/dist/css/foundation.min.css" crossorigin="anonymous">`
* putting `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` inside the `<a>` tag makes a new tab when you click on a link
* progress bar in foundation is similar to the badges in bootstrap. The color of the bar depends on the name of the class of the div.
Ex: `<div class="success progress"> </div>` creates a green bar
  * the completion of the bar is determined by a div class inside the progress div
  Ex: `<div class="progress-meter" style="width: 95%">` creates a bar that is 95% filled
  * you can show text on the bar using progress-meter-text `<span>` inside the progress meter div
  Ex: `<span class="progress-meter-text">95%</span>`
* <style></style> can be used to style

* q1:
We prefer the bootstrap FEF because the elements seem a lot more vibrant and customizable than foundation.
While it is probably possible to make a page using foundation as vibrant as a page using bootstrap, it seems like foundation requires more work.
The resources provided by bootstrap feel more modern and less dull than foundation.
