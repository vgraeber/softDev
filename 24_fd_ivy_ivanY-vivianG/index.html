        <td>
          During the summer of 2014 Ivan went on a trip with his summer camp to Build-A-Bear.
          He was taken through the process of stuffing and plushie and afterwards he had the opportunity to choose his own to help create.
          Out of the many choices presented to him, I was captured by the charm of Bob.
          He proceeded to fill the Bob with life and hearts containing his wishes and dreams.
          That is the story of how Bob became the ducky of Ivan Yeung. THE END.
        </td>
        <td>As I'm sure you all remember, one of the very first homeworks we had for SoftDev was to complete a google form. 
          Now Vivian, trying to complete the form on her way to school, noticed that it required a photo of a ducky. 
          To find one, she went to target and bought Squishy. Squishy was named Squishy because it was squishy. THE END.
